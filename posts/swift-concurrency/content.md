# Understanding Swift Concurrency

Swift's modern concurrency system makes it easier than ever to write safe, efficient concurrent code. Let's explore some key concepts.

## Async/Await

The `async/await` pattern is a game-changer for handling asynchronous code. Instead of dealing with completion handlers, we can write code that looks almost synchronous:

```swift
func fetchUserData() async throws -> User {
    let data = try await networkClient.fetch("/user")
    return try JSONDecoder().decode(User.self, from: data)
}
```

## Task Groups

Task groups allow us to run multiple operations concurrently and collect their results:

```swift
try await withThrowingTaskGroup(of: Image.self) { group in
    for url in urls {
        group.addTask {
            try await downloadImage(from: url)
        }
    }
    // Results are collected as they complete
}
```

## Actor Isolation

Actors help prevent data races by ensuring only one task can access their mutable state at a time:

```swift
actor ImageCache {
    private var cache: [URL: Image] = [:]
    
    func image(for url: URL) -> Image? {
        cache[url]
    }
    
    func setImage(_ image: Image, for url: URL) {
        cache[url] = image
    }
}
```

## Best Practices

1. Use `async/await` instead of completion handlers when possible
2. Leverage task groups for concurrent operations
3. Consider actors for shared mutable state
4. Always handle errors appropriately
